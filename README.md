# Blockchain-Assignment-with-Truffle
So in first video I have installed truffle-using truffle install -g.After that with the help of command truffle init-created a new contract known as helloworld.Also changed version of solidity.Installed solidity package in visula studio code.
Then I have created migrations file and tried to copile truffle with truffle compile command.
Then use truffle develop - we will get private keys.Then we can use truffle migrate -migrating contracts to our local network.
In test create a .js test file for helloworld. 
create secret.json file -install mnemonic 
install hardhat,alchemy-for ethereum mainnnet faucet-goerli.
